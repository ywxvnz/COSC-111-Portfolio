# Laboratory Activity #1: Working with Digital Signals

This laboratory activity demonstrates the use of digital signals in Arduino by creating a running light circuit.
It introduces Arduino as a basic platform for IoT system implementation and shows how digital outputs control electronic components.

## Objectives:
- Review Arduino as a device for IoT systems
- Understand digital signals and their implementation in an Arduino circuit

## Activity Summary:
Five LEDs were connected to digital pins 8 to 12. The LEDs turn ON one by one from pin 12 to pin 8 with a 1-second delay,
then turn OFF one by one in the same sequence. The LEDs are controlled using the digitalWrite() function.

## Output:
A running light effect where LEDs sequentially turn ON and OFF with a 1-second interval.
